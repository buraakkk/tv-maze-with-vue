## Reflection
 
This was a 5 days short project built for a technical assignment. Project goals included using technologies learned up until this point and familiarizing myself with documentation for new features.  

Originally I wanted to build an application that allowed users to search tvshows from the TV Maze API based on what they were interested in, such as 'most popular shows'. I started this process by using the `npm install -g @vue/cli` and  `vue create vue-frontend`. 

One of the main challenges I ran into was using a new framework. This lead me to spend a few days on a research spike into Vue and Quasar. Thanks to great documentation of Vue, I finished this assignment ahead of time. 

At the end of the day, the technologies implemented in this project are Node, VUE, QUASAR, and a significant amount of VanillaJS, and CSS. I chose to use the `vue create vue-frontend` boilerplate to minimize initial setup and invest more time in diving into weird technological rabbit holes. In the next iteration I plan on handrolling a `webpack.config.js` file to more fully understand the build process.
